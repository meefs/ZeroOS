# ZeroOS

_A universal modular Library OS (libOS) for zkVM-powered verifiable
applications._

ZeroOS is a modular library operating system that transforms normal applications
into verifiable applications (vApps) simply by linking against a lightweight,
platform-agnostic OS layer. Unlike prior zkVM stacks that rely on patched
toolchains and modified language runtimes, ZeroOS requires no changes to libc or
language standard libraries. Developers use off-the-shelf Rust/C toolchains,
link against ZeroOS, and obtain a deterministic, zkVM-compatible unikernel.

ZeroOS enables zkVMs to standardize around a shared OS layer—radically reducing
fragmentation, audit burden, and maintenance cost across the ecosystem. Every
zkVM platform integrating ZeroOS implements only one function:
__platform_bootstrap.

ZeroOS is open-source, built for extensibility, and designed to encourage
community contributions.

## Key Features

### Language-agnostic syscall shim

ZeroOS intercepts real syscall instructions and implements a stable subset of
the Linux syscall ABI inside the kernel.

- Works with unmodified musl libc and Rust `std`
- Eliminates version hell associated with patched toolchains
- Ensures long-term ABI stability (kernel ABIs are more stable than language
  runtimes)

### Modular architecture

ZeroOS is composed of small, swappable kernel modules:

- Memory allocators (freelist, buddy, bump, etc.)
- Syscall wrappers toggled via compile-time flags
- Swappable schedulers
- Optional I/O and device modules

Developers include _only_ what their vApp requires—minimizing trusted computing
base and zkVM trace length.

### Deterministic, zkVM-friendly design

Every subsystem is engineered to preserve determinism:

- No external nondeterminism (time, randomness, signals are stubbed or
  controlled)
- Single-address-space unikernel model
- All guest behavior is fully captured by the zkVM trace

### Minimal platform integration surface

To port ZeroOS to a zkVM, implement only:

```c
void __platform_bootstrap();
```

This function sets up:

- Trap handler registration
- Memory-mapped I/O regions
- Platform-specific device initialization

Everything else is shared across all platforms.

### Unikernel-style, static linking simplicity

ZeroOS builds a fully static ELF that runs directly on the zkVM’s bare-metal
execution model while preserving the familiar POSIX/Linux syscall interface.
